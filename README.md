### Intoduction :
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images—consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. Zalando intends Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.

The original MNIST dataset contains a lot of handwritten digits. Members of the AI/ML/Data Science community love this dataset and use it as a benchmark to validate their algorithms. In fact, MNIST is often the first dataset researchers try. "If it doesn't work on MNIST, it won't work at all", they said. "Well, if it does work on MNIST, it may still fail on others."

- To locate a pixel on the image, suppose that we have decomposed x as x = i * 28 + j, where i and j are integers between 0 and 27. The pixel is located on row i and column j of a 28 x 28 matrix.
- For example, pixel31 indicates the pixel that is in the fourth column from the left, and the second row from the top, as in the ascii-diagram below.

- Each row is a separate image
- Column 1 is the class label.
- Remaining columns are pixel numbers (784 total).
- Each value is the darkness of the pixel (1 to 255)

Problem- Classify the image which label exist. label value are [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,6,7,8,9]

## Pipeline for this dataset to solve the problem:
1. Load the Library
2. load the data (download the data)
3. Data Analysis
4. Preprocessing (scaling , normalization)
5. Build the model
6. Compile the model
7. fit the model
8. Evaluate the model
9. preidct the model
10. Check the accuracy  

Thanks
